Screen_sharing
==============

I have made a tool in adobe AIR, which can capture your screen on runtime and can send it to other user you’re connected to; mean to say that it is a kind of remote desktop component.
I have used an open source screen capture driver named” ScreenCapturer”. It helps me to capture the users screen. The basic idea behind this is that we are capturing screen data on enter Frame and storing it in byte array and then converting it into bitmap and displaying to user.
Driver provide us the data of user’s screen and we convert it into byte array and then into bitmapData. Some C# background processes are there in screen capture device.
